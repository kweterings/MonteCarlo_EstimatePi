###### Created by Kai Weterings, 12/08/2023

The following repository contain a code which produces an estimate of π using Monte Carlo methods.  
Monte Carlo methods is a type of 'computational algorithm that uses repeated random sampling to obtain the likelihood 
a range of results of occurring'[^1].
